------HELP------
*Where do I start?
	To begin just click File (Alt + F) and click New.

*What are those weird symbols next to the menu items?
	Those are short cut command to more easily issue commands to the program.
	the Ctrl + [letter] means that you need to hold down the Ctrl button and 
	then press the letter that is next to it.

How do I save?
	To save the progress that you have made on a map click the save button and
	your work will be saved. You can then continue to work or close out of the
	program and come back later and load your saved map file.

How do I load a map that I have saved?
	To load an existing map, just click the Load button, or go to File -> Load and
        select the level file (.lvl) that you wish to load.

How do I change different layers?
	click the down arrow next to the Edit button and choose the layer that you 
	want to start working on. Only one layer can be edited at a time.

How do I stop looking at a layer?
	To change what layer you are viewing, click the down arrow next to the View
	button and select or deselect what layer you want to look at or what layer
	you do not want to look at.
